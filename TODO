- fix documentation

- object creation is messy

- ArtPollReply to specific iface (depending on senders / receiver ip binding)

- ArtPoll -> find remote fixture -> allow Unicast / Broadcast mode for sender on ip subnet

- Example: 
    * bridge (receive on one ip range, send to another)
    * recorder (receive and store data with timestamp into file)
    * player (replay files to sender)
